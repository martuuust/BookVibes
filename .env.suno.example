# BookVibes - AI Song Generation Configuration
# 
# To enable real AI song generation with Suno AI, you need to:
# 1. Get an API key from a Suno AI API provider (e.g., https://sunoapi.org or https://musicapi.ai)
# 2. Add your API key below
# 3. Restart your application

# Suno AI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://sunoapi.org or https://musicapi.ai
SUNO_API_KEY=

# Optional: Custom API endpoint (if using a different provider)
# Default: https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1
SUNO_API_ENDPOINT=

# Note: Without an API key, the system will generate song metadata (lyrics, descriptions)
# but won't create actual audio files. Songs will be marked as "pending_generation"
